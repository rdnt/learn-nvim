# learn-nvim

Small repo that includes creation and running of a minimal container where I can
learn nvim and configure my dotfiles.

The dotfiles here are focused around my preferences (and are a work in progress)
but feel free to adapt for your own use.

Dependencies:
- Docker
- WSL 2 or Linux

Build:
```
./build.sh # or .\build.ps1 if using powershell
```

Run:
```
./run.sh # or .\run.ps1 if using powershell
```
